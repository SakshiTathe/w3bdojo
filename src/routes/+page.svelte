	<h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl">How does it work?</h2>
	<p class="mt-2">
		Each lesson will be composed of a brief reading section, code examples, and at the end a quiz /
		fill in the blank section. You can choose lessons in any order, as they donâ€™t build on one
		another. However, it is recommended that you start at the beginning and work your way through.
