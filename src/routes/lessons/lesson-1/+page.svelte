Most commonly seen are tags such as "a"(otherwise known as anchor tags, these are what links are on a page), "button", "select" etc. We will stick to these as they are simple examples, but take note that there are <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">many many more elements.</a> You can navigate through elements by using tab to move forwards, and shift + tab to move backwards.
