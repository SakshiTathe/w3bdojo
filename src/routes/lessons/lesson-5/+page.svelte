	Good job for making it to the end. Hopefully you found the tutorial easy to take in and learned a
	few things. Check out MDN docs on Aria if you want to get into the less essential details of Aria,
	and check out WCAG to get a more in depth-overview of accessibility in general. These are both
	great resources.

	If you have suggestions, ideas, or would like to contribute in any way, feel free to submit a
	proposal on the GitHub repository! The project is fully open source, and I welcome your input.
